DiMLex - Structure
=============

The lexicon is constructed of a number of lexicon entries, numbered by an 'id'. 

Schematically, each entry consists of the following data fields:

<orth/> List of orthographic variants for this entry. One variant is marked as the 'canonical' spelling.
	A connective can be 'phrasal' or a 'single' item, furthermore, phrasal connectives can be 'cont'inuous or 'discont'inuous

<disambi/> Information on whether this form is ambiguous between a connective/non-connective reading (<conn_d/>) and different semantic readings (<sem_d/>).

<dict_info/> Legacy information from printed dictionaries about this connective.

<conn_disambi/> Disambiguation rules that distinguish between connective/non-connective usages.

<focuspart/> Whether or not this connective allows for associated focus particles.

<correlate/> Some connectives frequently appear with "correlates" to mark a discourse relation. 
	It is noted whether the connective is a correlate (<is_correlate/>) of another one or whether it can have correlates (<has_correlate/>).

<non_conn_reading/> Examples and possible POS tags of a usage of this item in its non-connective reading.

<stts/> Common POS tags, with examples and corpus frequencies.

<syn/> Syntactic and semantic information on this connective. 
       For ambiguous connectives (that are also syntactically ambiguous), several <syn/>-blocks are allowed.
       The syntax block is further divided into the following components:

      <cat/> Syntactic category.
      	     For German, one of: konnadv (adverb), padv (adverb with prepositional part), konj (coordinating conjunction), postp (postponer), praep (preposition), subj (subordinating conjunction), v2emb (v2-embedder), einzel (isolated)

      <integr/> For adverbs, indication in which syntactic positions they can occur (traditional German 'Felder'-syntax). 

      <ordering/> Options for the linear order of arguments arg1 and arg2: ante, post, insert, and/or desintegr

      <sem/> One <sem/>-block is listed for each semantic relation that can be expressed with this syntax.
      	     Several <sem/>-blocks per <syn/>-block are allowed.
      	     Each <sem/>-block includes:
        <coherence_relations/> Expressed coherence relations, according to different classification schemes.
        <sem_disambi/> Disambiguation rules for this semantic reading (pros/cons).
        <role_linking/> Which syntactic argument (arg1/arg2) is linked to which semantic argument in this relation?
        <examples/> Examples for the connective usage in this semantic reading.
